Insertlessly

Waste no more time entering insert mode just to insert enters!

Are you sick of having to go into insert mode -just- to enter a
newline? Do you wish Vim had an even easier way of entering several
newlines at once? Are you sick of people on #vim telling you:

  "just use o<Esc> and get over it already!"?


Well, wish no more! Because, -this- plugin is for you!!1!
